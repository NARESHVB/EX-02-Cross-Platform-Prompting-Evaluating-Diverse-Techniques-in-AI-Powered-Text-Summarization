# EX-02-Cross-Platform-Prompting-Evaluating-Diverse-Techniques-in-AI-Powered-Text-Summarization


üéØ AIM
The primary aim of this experiment is to evaluate and compare how different prompting strategies perform across major AI platforms when summarizing a moderately technical article. Specifically, it seeks to find out which combination of AI platform and prompt style produces the most accurate, coherent, simple, and user-friendly summary of a 500-word article on "The Basics of Blockchain Technology." This will help determine the most effective setup for content curation teams aiming to deliver quick, digestible educational material to undergraduate students.

üß† Prompting Techniques Overview
This section introduces the four different prompt strategies that guide how an AI generates responses:
Zero-shot: The AI is simply asked to perform the task without any examples. It tests the model‚Äôs general understanding of instructions.


Few-shot: The AI is given 1‚Äì3 examples of what kind of input/output is expected. This helps the model understand the pattern or style needed.


Chain-of-thought (CoT): The prompt instructs the AI to reason step-by-step before giving a final summary. This is especially useful for complex or technical material that requires logical structuring.


Role-based: The prompt assigns the AI a specific role (e.g., "You are a college professor explaining to first-year students"). This frames the response in a more tailored, audience-appropriate way.


Each of these techniques may guide the model‚Äôs behavior differently, and their effectiveness can vary depending on the platform.

‚öôÔ∏è Algorithm (Procedure)
This outlines the systematic steps used to run the experiment:
Choose the article: A consistent, 500-word technical article on blockchain is selected for all tests to ensure fairness.


Design prompts: Create one prompt for each technique‚Äîzero-shot, few-shot, CoT, and role-based.


Run on platforms: Use the same prompts on four platforms‚ÄîChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Copilot.


Set evaluation metrics: Define criteria such as accuracy, coherence, simplicity, speed, and user experience.


Generate and collect summaries: For each combination (platform + prompt), generate the summary and note down the response time.


Score each output: Have evaluators rate each summary using the pre-defined criteria on a scale (e.g., 1‚Äì5).


Analyze results: Tabulate and compare the scores to determine which combination is most effective.


Draw conclusions: Identify patterns and make recommendations based on the scores.

This table is used to record and compare the results across different combinations. It has:
Platform and Prompting Technique: Lists the tested combinations.


Evaluation Metrics:


Accuracy: How faithful the summary is to the original article.


Coherence: Whether the summary flows logically.


Simplicity: Whether it's easy to understand for undergrads.


Speed: How quickly the response is generated.


User Experience: How easy and intuitive the platform is to use.


Average Score: The mean of all the metrics for that combination, helping rank effectiveness.


This format makes it easy to visually compare and identify top-performing methods.

‚úÖ Sample Conclusion
This section draws insight from the experiment‚Äôs results. For example:
‚ÄúFew-shot prompting using ChatGPT outperformed others by providing concise yet accurate summaries that were highly readable and quick to produce. Claude performed best under Chain-of-Thought prompting, particularly excelling in breaking down complex ideas. Gemini's role-based approach was also strong in terms of tone and clarity. Microsoft Copilot lagged behind in comprehension, especially with zero-shot prompts. Overall, the results suggest that giving examples (few-shot) or guiding the reasoning (CoT) significantly improves summary quality on most platforms.‚Äù
This final analysis helps the content curation team make informed decisions about which tools and techniques to use moving forward.

Would you like me to help design actual prompts for each strategy across one of the platforms (e.g., ChatGPT)?

üéØ AIM (Expanded Points)
Benchmark AI summarization performance in a real-world educational use case.


Identify the best prompting strategy that aligns with undergraduate-level comprehension needs.


Measure platform consistency and reliability in text summarization across different AI systems.


Provide data-driven guidance to help your content team select tools and prompts for future summarization tasks.


Explore how prompt engineering influences output quality, especially for technical topics.



üß† Prompting Techniques Overview (Expanded Points)
Zero-shot: Tests the AI‚Äôs ability to understand task instructions from minimal input. Useful when speed is critical, but often leads to generic or inconsistent outputs.


Few-shot: Enhances reliability and output structure by showing examples. Encourages closer alignment with user expectations, especially for style and length.


Chain-of-thought (CoT): Simulates human reasoning to improve logical clarity. Often results in more detailed, structured summaries, though it may be slower.


Role-based: Adds context through a defined persona. Helps align tone and complexity level with the target audience, such as undergraduates.


These techniques represent different levels of AI guidance: from minimal (zero-shot) to highly directed (role-based/CoT).



‚öôÔ∏è Algorithm (Procedure) (Expanded Points)
Standardize input: Ensure that every AI model receives the same article and instruction set for valid comparisons.


Create evaluation rubrics: Develop a scoring guide with clear definitions for each metric (e.g., what qualifies as a ‚Äú5‚Äù in simplicity).


Repeatability: Run each prompt-platform combo at least twice to account for variation in AI output randomness.


Time each output: Record the latency from input submission to summary generation for speed scoring.


Blind evaluation: Remove platform labels during scoring to reduce bias in evaluator judgment.


Aggregate and visualize data: Use graphs to better illustrate which platform and prompting combination excels across multiple criteria.



üìä Result Template (Example Format) (Expanded Points)
Use a tabular matrix to present individual and average scores clearly.


Add a standard deviation column if you're running multiple tests per combination, to show consistency.


Create heatmaps or bar charts from the data to better visualize performance trends.


Add qualitative notes (e.g., "too much jargon" or "excellent summary tone") alongside scores for richer context.


Include a "rank" column to quickly identify top-performing combinations per metric.



‚úÖ Sample Conclusion (Expanded Points)
Highlight top performers for each individual metric (e.g., Gemini for speed, Claude for coherence).


Recommend best overall combo for your specific goal (e.g., ‚ÄúChatGPT + Few-shot is best for education-oriented summaries‚Äù).


Call out weaknesses (e.g., ‚ÄúCopilot struggled with coherence in technical summaries using zero-shot‚Äù).


Balance performance and practicality: A slower platform might deliver the best summary, but may not be viable for high-volume tasks.


Suggest improvements (e.g., ‚ÄúUsing role-based prompting plus a few-shot structure might enhance Claude‚Äôs outputs further‚Äù).


Scalability consideration: Assess whether the method can be scaled across hundreds of documents with consistent quality.


Training and skill impact: Point out whether some techniques require more prompt engineering skill, which affects who can use them effectively.
